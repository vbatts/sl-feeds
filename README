hack scripts

They accomplish going from ChangeLog.txt -> RSS feeds that folks can subscribed to.
Ultimately ending up at http://www.slackware.com/~vbatts/feeds/

These are a mess, but still work.

I wrote a utility called slack-utils (https://github.com/vbatts/slack-utils/)
with a ruby gem (https://rubygems.org/gems/slack-utils). The python script
(`./bin/changelog_http_poll.py`) is called by a crontab. Python walks the
changelog.txt, then fetches from the http mirror the modified time. If it http
has the new version, then run the ruby script (`./bin/gen_changlog_rss.rb`).
This is what parses the changelog and returns RSS. Which is then written to the
corresponding file for public consumption.
