  back to using xf86-input-evdev as before.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside
    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

  from unprivileged processes.
  Thanks to Philip Pettersson for discovering the bug and providing a patch.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial
  of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal;
  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

  This kernel fixes a security issue known as "Dirty COW".  A race
  condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem
  handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only
  memory mappings.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to
  gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus
  increase their privileges on the system.

d/guile-2.0.12-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Match timestamps across all $ARCH on *.go and *.scm files, otherwise
  on multilib systems the compiled (go) files may be detected as older
  than the source (scm) files, causing guile to attempt to recompile
  itself with every use.

l/gtk+2-2.24.31-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue:  Integer overflow in the
  gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf function in gdk/gdkcairo.c allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large image file,
  which triggers a large memory allocation.

n/gnutls-3.4.15-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  libgnutls: Corrected the comparison of the serial size in OCSP response.
  Previously the OCSP certificate check wouldn't verify the serial length
  and could succeed in cases it shouldn't (GNUTLS-SA-2016-3).
  Reported by Stefan Buehler.

  crypt(3) function via sshd(8).
  sshd(8): Mitigate timing differences in password authentication that could
  be used to discern valid from invalid account names when long passwords were
  sent and particular password hashing algorithms are in use on the server.
  ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC padding oracle
  countermeasures. 
  ssh(1), sshd(8): Improve operation ordering of MAC verification for
  Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC algorithms to verify the MAC
  before decrypting any ciphertext.

  Changes to pkgtool:
  Remove option to install from floppy disks.
  Don't use the --file option, which appears to be broken in the latest version
  of dialog.  The only reason --file was ever used in the first place was to
  work around the Linux ARG_MAX limit of 131072 bytes, and since Linux 2.6.23 a
  much larger limit is in place making it unlikely to become an issue again.
  So we'll go back to passing the package list on the command line.

n/samba-4.4.5-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes a security issue:
  Client side SMB2/3 required signing can be downgraded.
  It's possible for an attacker to downgrade the required signing for an
  SMB2/3 client connection, by injecting the SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST or
  SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL flags.  This means that the attacker can
  impersonate a server being connected to by Samba, and return malicious
  results.

Slackware 14.2 x86_64 stable is released!

The long development cycle (the Linux community has lately been living in
"interesting times", as they say) is finally behind us, and we're proud to
announce the release of Slackware 14.2.  The new release brings many updates
and modern tools, has switched from udev to eudev (no systemd), and adds
well over a hundred new packages to the system.  Thanks to the team, the
upstream developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else
who pitched in to help make this release a reality.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Have fun!  :-)
