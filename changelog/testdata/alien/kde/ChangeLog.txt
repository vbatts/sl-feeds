14.2/latest/x86_64 : Here are the promised KDE 5_17.02 packages for
  Slackware 14.2 (64bit only).

+--------------------------+
Thu Feb 16 19:39:41 UTC 2017
current/latest/x86_64/kde/plasma: added missing 'alien' tag to the packages.

+--------------------------+
Wed Feb 15 13:25:56 UTC 2017
Here is KDE 5_17.02 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.31.0,
  Plasma 5.9.2 and Applications 16.12.2 on top of Qt 5.7.1.
  KDE-5_17.02 is meant to be installed on top of Slackware -current.  For the
  moment, I will not be offering new packages for Slackware 14.2.
  Upgrading from the previous 5_17.01 is straight-forward.  Please read
  the accompanying README file for detailed installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  Use only the current "latest" repository and not "testing" which I emptied:
    http://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/latest/

+--------------------------+
Tue Feb 14 13:23:11 UTC 2017
Removed the repositories for Slackware 13.37 and 14.1 to conserve diskspace
  on my internet-facing server.

+--------------------------+
Mon Jan 30 21:44:50 UTC 2017
current/latest/kde/applications-extra/calligra: rebuilt against the newer
  poppler (64bit only, because 32bit is fine).

+--------------------------+
Sun Jan 29 23:17:55 UTC 2017
Good feedback was received from my Slackware friends visiting the blog.
  As a result of the discussion there, it seemed prudent to recompile the
  following packages on Slackware-current:
    deps/poppler (updated to match the version in Slackware-current)
    applications/okular
    frameworks/kfilemetadata5 (both because of the bump in poppler version)
    deps/sip
    deps/PyQt
    kde4/pykde4 (all three because of the changes in slackware-current's python)
    kde4/korundum
    kde4/qtruby (these two because of the ruby update in -current)
    frameworks/sonnet (because of hunspell update in -current)
    kdepim/akonadi (to get rid of the hardcoded stdlib path in a header,
      containing the gcc version number in the path)
  Also, I have uploaded the packages for 32bit Slackware-current.  Note that
  there will not be Plasma5 updates for 32bit Slackware 14.2 any longer.

+--------------------------+
Thu Jan 26 22:24:44 UTC 2017
Here is KDE 5_17.01 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.30.0,
  Plasma 5.8.5 and Applications 16.12.1 on top of Qt 5.7.1.
  KDE-5_17.01 is meant to be installed on top of Slackware 14.2 or -current.
  It will *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
  Upgrading from the previous 5_16.12 needs a bit of tender care & loving this
  time.  In particular, the new quarterly release of the Applications brings
  a lot of change. Many packages have been added, but also many packages are
  no longer part of the 'ktown' repository.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!
  Use only the "latest" repositories and not "testing" which is out of date:
    https://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/14.2/latest/
  or:
    https://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/latest/

+--------------------------+
Fri Dec  9 21:03:28 UTC 2016
Here is KDE 5_16.12 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.28.0,
  Plasma 5.8.4 and Applications 16.08.3 on top of Qt 5.7.0.
  I wanted to have the last 16.08.x release of KDE Applications available in
  my repository before the new 16.12.x releases start coming.  There are
  some big changes in Applications 16.12 for which I need to time to review,
  plan and build packages.  Therefore you will probably not see packages
  for Applications 16.12.0 in 2016.
  The upgrade from the previous KDE 5_16.11 should be smooth.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!
  Use only the "latest" repositories and not "testing" which is out of date:
    https://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/14.2/latest/

  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+

  Upgrade from the previous KDE 5_16.07 should be smooth.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!
  Also note that the 'ktown' repository has a new "current/testing" branch
  which contains packages (64bit only!) for testing the Wayland support
  in Plasma 5 for Slackware.  If you are interested in my regular 'ktown'
  packages then please use only the "latest" repositories and not "testing":
    https://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/14.2/latest/
  or:
    https://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/latest/

+--------------------------+
Sat Jul 23 19:28:29 UTC 2016
deps/poppler: added a recompiled Slackware package which adds Qt5 support on
  top of the Qt4 support which was already present.
14.2/latest/kde/kde4/baloo: recompiled in order to remove the overlap with the
  baloo5 package (the probable cause of the broken search in krunner).
14.2/latest/kde/kde4/frameworks/: recompiled kfilemetadata5 in order to pick
  up popper's Qt5 support, and them recompiled baloo5 for good measure.

+--------------------------+

14.2/latest/kde/plasma: re-added breeze-gtk and plasma-workspace-wallpapers
  (64bit only) which I had inadvertently moved to my archive along with the
  old breeze and plasma-workspace packages (oh, the curse of using wildcards).

+--------------------------+
Fri Jul  8 14:12:43 UTC 2016
14.2/latest/kde/plasma: rebuilt the following packages (64bit only) which
  still had dependencies on the now removed Wayland support in qt5, mesa and
  xorg-server: breeze, kwayland-integration, plasma-integration, kinfocenter,
  kscreenlocker, kwin, libkscreen2, plasma-workspace and powerdevil.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jul  6 21:40:21 UTC 2016
current/testing/deps: (64bit only) removed mesa, elogind and xorg-server
  packages that were intended for a new testing repository targeting wayland
  support. They were not meant to be published already. Please re-install
  Slackware's version of mesa and xorg-server and check your Nvidia binary
  blob if you use that.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jul  6 12:07:03 UTC 2016
NOTICE: my 'ktown' repository for Plasma5 has been promoted from 'testing'
  to 'stable'. This means, 'ktown' repository for Slackware 14.2 now offers
  the Plasma5 desktop under 'latest', consisting of Frameworks 5.23.0,
  Plasma 5.7 and Applications 16.04.2.
  Repository URL: http://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/14.2/latest/
  The old testing repository for Slackware-current will soon start moving
  again, investigating the useability of Wayland. For the time being the URL
  http://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/testing/ will point to
  the stable repository (using symlinks).

Sun Nov 22 13:15:17 UTC 2015
The remainining 32bit packages have noew been recompiled (qt5, step,
  akonadi4, akonadi, akonadi-search, akonadi-calendar, kdepimlibs, sddm-qt5)
  and everything should be working again.  Tell me if some package still
  complains about missing libraries.

+--------------------------+
Sat Nov 21 23:58:50 UTC 2015
Packages that were recompiled as a result of the 'Fri Nov 20 05:25:18 UTC 2015'

  KDE-5_15.10 is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and
  it will *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
  What is NEW:
  - a rebuilt sddm-qt5 package which fixes the broken progress bar on startup
    of the Plasma Desktop session.

    dependencies (18 new packages).
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sat Sep 19 12:24:59 UTC 2015

+--------------------------+
Wed Sep 16 11:03:54 UTC 2015
current/testing/deps/grantlee-qt4: added because KDEvelop still needs this.
current/testing/kde/kde4/oktetapart4: added to provide HEX editor integration
  for the still KDE4-based KDEvelop.

+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 14 21:29:39 UTC 2015
Here is a second September release of KDE 5 for Slackware-current.
  KDE 5_15.09_02 consists of the KDE Frameworks 5.14.0, Plasma 5.4.1
  and Applications 15.08.1.
  Two changes in the "deps" section: LoginKit was removed (it caused a
  minute-long delay in logging out and is useless at this point);
  and a recompiled version of libproxy was added (removed KDE 4 support).
  Upgrading from the previous KDE 5_15.09 should be an easy ride.
  Note:
  KDE-5_15.09_02 is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current
  and it will *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed Sep  2 12:25:00 UTC 2015
current/latest/deps/phonon-vlc: rebuilt against vlc 2.2.1 on uptodate -current.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jul  8 13:03:01 UTC 2015
This is KDE 5_15.07 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.12.0,
  Plasma 5.3.2 and Applications 15.04.3.
  Compared to my KDE 5_15.06 no further changes were made apart from
  the updates to Frameworks, Plasma and Applications.
  Note:
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 13 21:55:27 UTC 2015
14.1/4.14.3/deps/qt: removed my qt-4.8.6 package (containing some KDE related
  patches) because now Slackware 14.1 has qt-4.8.7 with those same patches in
  its official repository. I encourage you to upgrade to that version.

+--------------------------+
Mon Jun 01 19:49:40 UTC 2015
This is KDE 5_15.06 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.10.0,
  Plasma 5.3.1 and Applications 15.04.2.  Compared to my KDE 5_15.05 the only
  updates are the new set of Applications packages.  This includes LTS
  (Long Term Support) updates for kdelibs, kdepimlibs, kdepim, kdepim-runtime
  and kde-workspace.
  One package is new:
  - kde4-extragear/kdeconnect4 contains the essentials of the KDE4 based
    kdeconnect-kde which will allow you to access your Android device with the
    (also still KDE4 based) Dolphin.  This package therefore fixes the errors
    you would get if you tried to access your Android device in Plasma 5.
  One package has been modified:
  - kde4/kactivities, the KDE4 based version, no longer contains the
    kactivitymanagerd binary.
    The same daemon in the kactivities-framework works fine with the KDE4 based
    activities libraries. When installing all my KDE5 packages in one massive
    upgrade, the kactivities package would get installed after the
    kactivities-framework package and the KDE4 based kactivitymanagerd would
    overwrite the Frameworks version, causing serious desktop crashes.
  Note:
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE4 you might have installed!
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Mon May 25 23:27:53 UTC 2015
Here is KDE 5_15.05 for Slackware.  This is mostly a maintenance release
  for all components; there's no new packages or functionality.
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you migh thave installed!
  New & changed since the previous KDE 5_15.04 release:
  - kde/frameworks packages were updated to 5.10.0. No new Frameworks this time.
    See also https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.10.0.php
  - kde/plasma packages were updated to 5.3.1. This is a maintenance release,
    see also https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.3.1.php
  - kde/applications packages were updated to 15.04.1. This is a bugfix release,
    see also https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-15.04.1.php
  - kde/kde4, new LTS (Long Term Support) versions of kdelibs, kdepim*
  - deps directory: I have removed qt-gstreamer0 because I do not think any
    package uses it.  Slackware has moved to gstreamer-1 and furthermore, the
    contents of qt-gstreamer and qt-gstreamer0 paackages had a partial overlap
    in their files.  Be sure to re-install qt-gstreamer just in case.
  - I fixed the missing shutdown/reboot and suspend/hibernate options in the
    menu by adding several Polkit policy files to the powerdevil package.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 29 21:14:01 UTC 2015
Updates to both the "latest" and "testing" repositories for slackware-current!
current/latest/ : KDE 4.14.3 packages have all been removed - all but one:
  the phonon-vlc package is still available and has been recompiled against
  vlc-2.2.1. The rest of KDE 4.14.3 plus dependencies is now an official part
  of Slackware-current since 21-april-2015.
current/testing/ : Here you will find the all-new KDE 5_15.04 for
  slackware-current, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.9.0, Plasma 5.3.0
  and Applications 15.04.0.  This is meant only to be installed on top of
  the latest Slackware-current and it will *replace* any version of KDE 4
  you might have installed!
  - Note that I did not compile the new Plasma Mediacenter tech-preview, the new
    KDEnlive and KDE Telepathy. They need a lot of attention before I can build
    them and it was more important to me to have a new release of KDE 5 out
    as fast as possible, that works with the latest slackware-current.
  - kde/kde4-extragear is completely emptied - you should use the packages
    from slackware-current (calligra, k3b, kaudiocreator, kplayer, kwebkitpart,
    oxygen-gtk2, oxygen-gtk3, kdevplatform, kdevelop-pg-qt, kdevelop,
    kdev-python, kdevelop-php, kdevelop-php-docs, skanlite, kio-mtp,
    libktorrent, ktorrent, partitionmanager).  Report any breakage!
  - deps directory has three new packages (PyQt5, cfitsio, grantlee-qt5);
    updates for PyQt, qt5 and sip; and the rest has been recompiled just to be
    sure they are compatible with slackware-current.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!  Especially important after the recent mass-update
  in slackware-current.

Tue Apr  7 09:29:53 UTC 2015
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.14.3 for Slackware 14.1. yes, 14.1!
  This release includes the latest version of the Plasma Workspaces, 4.11.17,
  as well as other Long Term Support (LTS) updates: kdelibs and kdepim 4.14.6.
  The set of packages includes the most recent versions of the Calligra
  office suite (2.9.1) and Kdevelop (4.7.1) packages.
  There were some other noteworthy updates (k3b, partitionmanager) and
  additions (kdeconnect-kde, plasma-nm) in the 'extragear' department. 
  I added a phonon-vlc package, which of course will only work if you also
  install my vlc package - some people prefer the vlc backend for phonon to
  the gstreamer or the ancient mplayer backend. 
  All this means that compared to Slackware 14.1's KDE several dependencies
  were updated and added.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Mon Mar 30 06:13:49 UTC 2015
Time to give KDE 4.14.3 some attention. I have updated several packages
  with Long Term Support (LTS) versions taken from Applications 14.12.3 and
  also updated the Calligra office suite.
  For that reason, I also had to refresh some of the 'deps'.
current/4.14.3/deps/grantlee: updated to 0.5.1.
current/4.14.3/deps/libodfgen: added 0.1.3 (dependency for libwpd).
current/4.14.3/deps/librevenge: added 0.0.2 (dependency for libwpd).
current/4.14.3/deps/libssh: updated to 0.6.4.
current/4.14.3/deps/libwpd: updated to 0.10.0.
current/4.14.3/kde/calligra: updated to 2.9.1.

This is KDE 5_15.03 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.8.0,
  Plasma 5.2.2 and Applications 14.12.3.
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you migh thave installed!
+--------------------------+

Here is KDE 5_15.09 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.13.0,
  Plasma 5.4.0 and Applications 15.08.0.
  This is an intrusive update if you currently have my KDE 5_15.07 packages
  installed. Consider this to be beta-quality because there may be some
  usability issues - read the "BUILD NOTES" section inside the README very
  carefully before you decide to upgrade.
  I need testers to iron out some annoying regressions.
  Note:
  KDE-5_15.09 is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and
  it will *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed Sep  2 12:25:00 UTC 2015
current/latest/deps/phonon-vlc: rebuilt against vlc 2.2.1 on uptodate -current.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jul  8 13:03:01 UTC 2015
This is KDE 5_15.07 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.12.0,
  Plasma 5.3.2 and Applications 15.04.3.
  Compared to my KDE 5_15.06 no further changes were made apart from
  the updates to Frameworks, Plasma and Applications.
  Note:
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 13 21:55:27 UTC 2015
14.1/4.14.3/deps/qt: removed my qt-4.8.6 package (containing some KDE related
  patches) because now Slackware 14.1 has qt-4.8.7 with those same patches in
  its official repository. I encourage you to upgrade to that version.

+--------------------------+
Mon Jun 01 19:49:40 UTC 2015
This is KDE 5_15.06 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.10.0,
  Plasma 5.3.1 and Applications 15.04.2.  Compared to my KDE 5_15.05 the only
  updates are the new set of Applications packages.  This includes LTS
  (Long Term Support) updates for kdelibs, kdepimlibs, kdepim, kdepim-runtime
  and kde-workspace.
  One package is new:
  - kde4-extragear/kdeconnect4 contains the essentials of the KDE4 based
    kdeconnect-kde which will allow you to access your Android device with the
    (also still KDE4 based) Dolphin.  This package therefore fixes the errors
    you would get if you tried to access your Android device in Plasma 5.
  One package has been modified:
  - kde4/kactivities, the KDE4 based version, no longer contains the
    kactivitymanagerd binary.
    The same daemon in the kactivities-framework works fine with the KDE4 based
    activities libraries. When installing all my KDE5 packages in one massive
    upgrade, the kactivities package would get installed after the
    kactivities-framework package and the KDE4 based kactivitymanagerd would
    overwrite the Frameworks version, causing serious desktop crashes.
  Note:
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE4 you might have installed!
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Mon May 25 23:27:53 UTC 2015
Here is KDE 5_15.05 for Slackware.  This is mostly a maintenance release
  for all components; there's no new packages or functionality.
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you migh thave installed!
  New & changed since the previous KDE 5_15.04 release:
  - kde/frameworks packages were updated to 5.10.0. No new Frameworks this time.
    See also https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.10.0.php
  - kde/plasma packages were updated to 5.3.1. This is a maintenance release,
    see also https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.3.1.php
  - kde/applications packages were updated to 15.04.1. This is a bugfix release,
    see also https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-15.04.1.php
  - kde/kde4, new LTS (Long Term Support) versions of kdelibs, kdepim*
  - deps directory: I have removed qt-gstreamer0 because I do not think any
    package uses it.  Slackware has moved to gstreamer-1 and furthermore, the
    contents of qt-gstreamer and qt-gstreamer0 paackages had a partial overlap
    in their files.  Be sure to re-install qt-gstreamer just in case.
  - I fixed the missing shutdown/reboot and suspend/hibernate options in the
    menu by adding several Polkit policy files to the powerdevil package.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 29 21:14:01 UTC 2015
Updates to both the "latest" and "testing" repositories for slackware-current!
current/latest/ : KDE 4.14.3 packages have all been removed - all but one:
  the phonon-vlc package is still available and has been recompiled against
  vlc-2.2.1. The rest of KDE 4.14.3 plus dependencies is now an official part
  of Slackware-current since 21-april-2015.

    libktorrent, ktorrent, partitionmanager).  Report any breakage!
  - deps directory has three new packages (PyQt5, cfitsio, grantlee-qt5);
    updates for PyQt, qt5 and sip; and the rest has been recompiled just to be
    sure they are compatible with slackware-current.

  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you migh thave installed!

  New & changed since my KDE 5_15.02_02 release:
  - kde/frameworks packages were updated to 5..8.0. Two Frameworks were added:
    + KPeople, provides access to all contacts and the people who hold them

    new release of libwpd)

  NOTE:
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!
  Upgrading to this KDE 5 is non-trivial.
  You will have to *remove* old KDE packages manually.  If you do not have KDE
  installed at all, you will have to *install* some of Slackware's own KDE
  packages manually.

+--------------------------+
Fri Feb 27 21:08:57 UTC 2015
current/5/kde/plasma/libksysguard: rebuilt to move dbus files.

*replace* any version of KDE 4 you migh thave installed!

New & changed since my KDE 5_15.02 release:
- deps/libssh version 0.6.4 was re-added, this was still missing after I moved
  from KDE 4.14.3 To KDE 5. The updated version is required by kde-runtime.

  https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.2.1.php
- kde/frameworks/kglobalaccel was rebuilt. It broke after the upgrade of
  plasma-workspace because it had picked up an unneeded dependency.
- kde/applications/kde-runtime was rebuilt. With the newer libssh in place,
  the 'sftp' kioslave is built as well.

current/5/kde/kde4/calligra: rebuilt the 64-bit package against the newer
  exiv2 package (fixes error while loading shared libraries: libexiv2.so.12).

+--------------------------+
Tue Jan 27 22:34:18 UTC 2015
This is KDE 5 for Slackware.
  It consists of Frameworks 5.6.0, Plasma 5.2.0 and Applications 14.12.1.
  This is meant only to be installed on top of Slackware -current and it will
  *replace* any version of KDE 4 you migh thave installed!

  Plasma 5 is the next generation of KDE's desktop workspace.
  Plasma 5 improves support for high-DPI displays and comes with a "converged
  shell", i.e. one Plasma codebase for different target devices.  Plasma 5 uses
  a new fully hardware-accelerated OpenGL(ES) graphics stack.  Plasma 5 is built
  using Qt 5 and Frameworks 5.
  And with the Breeze themed artwork and its own Oxygen font, this desktop looks
  clean and modern.

  Further points of interest:
  - Lots of packages in the 'deps' department which are completely new to
    Slackware. Since KDE 5 is built on Qt5 (KDE 4 had Qt4 as its base) you'll
    find many Qt5 related packages. Also, in ordet for Qt4 and GTK based
    applications to dock into the Plasma 5 system tray, more dependencies were
    needed. So, apart from updates to regular Slackware packages, these are the
    new ones:
    LibRaw, OpenAL, akonadi-qt5, eigen3, gst1-plugins-base, gst1-plugins-good,
    gstreamer1, json-glib, libappindicator, libdbusmenu-gtk, libdbusmenu-qt5,
    libepoxy, libfakekey, libindicator, orc, polkit-qt5-1, qca-qt5,
    qt-gstreamer, qt-gstreamer1, qt5, sni-qt, wayland and xapian-core.
  - Note for users of multilib Slackware64 and also using Skyoe: you will have
    to grab the 32-bit version of sni-qt and run convertpkg-compat32'' on it,
    or else Skype won't be able to dock its icon in the systray.
  - A bit sneakily, I built phonon-vlc for you.  You will also need a VLC
    package to be able to use this package though.
  - I added the latest Calligra 2.8.7 office suite.
  - Even though I compile a 'kde-workspace' package as part of the whole set,
    I do not ship that package. It conflicts with the new plasma-workspace
    package.
  - Several source tarballs in Plasma 5.2.0 have not been compiled to Slackware
    packages: libbluedevil and bluedevil (they need BlueZ 5 which is not part of
    Slackware), muon (a debian/ubuntu package manager), libkface (needs opencv
    which I was not willing to add as a dependency).
  - One dependency which you'll probably find curious, is wayland. It is
    required in order to *compile* KWin's X11 driver, but it is apparently
    not needed at *runtime*. Nevertheless, I left the package in, just in case
    you want or need to recompile kwin.
  - Graphical login: KDM has been replaced with SDDDM.

  NOTE:
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!
  Upgrading to this KDE 5 is non-trivial.

+--------------------------+
Tue Nov 11 23:35:57 UTC 2014
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.14.3 for Slackware-current!
  This release includes the latest version of the Plasma Workspaces, 4.11.14.
  Kactivities was taken from the 4.13.3 sources because that too, is missing
  from KDE 4.14.
  The set of packages includes the most recent versions of the Calligra
  office suite and Kdevelop packages.
  There were some other noteworthy updates in the 'extragear' department:
  k3b, kdeconnect-kde, plasma-nm and partitionmanager.
  And I sneaked some stuff in, which may not be of interest to everyone.  To
  phonon, phonon-getreamer, qt-gstreamer1 I added Qt5 bindings, so that you
  can use them with KDE 5.  And I added a phonon-vlc package, which of course
  will only work if you also install my vlc package - some people prefer the
  vlc backend for phonon to the gstreamer or the ancient mplayer backend. 
  This means that compared to the previous KDE 4.14.2, several dependencies
  were updated (phonon, phonon-gstreamer) and added (gstreamer1,
  gst1-plugins-base, gst1-plugins-good, libfakekey, orc, qt-gstreamer1).
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

  version 2.8.6.  The Kdevelop packages were updated to their latest versions.
  Compared to the previous KDE 4.14.1, no dependencies were updated.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 16 20:41:10 UTC 2014
KDE5 for Slackware, has the Frameworks updated to 5.2.0.  The Plasma version
  was updated to 5.0.2.  The dependencies are unchanged.
  This is only useful if installed on top of Slackware -current and my KDE 4.14
  packages (plus dependencies).  KDE5 is still a work in progress and needs the
  KDE4 applications, libraries and artwork.

+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 16 20:41:10 UTC 2014
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.14.1 for Slackware-current!
  The release includes the latest version of the Plasma Workspaces, 4.11.12.

Tue Aug 12 20:34:02 UTC 2014
This is a first preview for Slackware, of the KDE Frameworks 5.1.0 combined
  with Plasma 5.0.1.
  This is only useful if installed on top of Slackware -current and my KDE 4.13
  package (plus dependencies).  KDE5 is still a work in progress and needs the
  KDE4 applications, libraries and artwork.
  Plasma 5.0 is the next generation of KDE's desktop workspace.
  Plasma 5.0 improves support for high-DPI displays and comes with a "converged
  shell", i.e. one Plasma codebase for different target devices.  Plasma 5 uses

14.1/4.12.5/kde/kwalletmanager:  Moved the files in /etc/kde/ to /etc/ .  This
  fixes a bug in the SlackBuild caused by this package having been renamed

  policy didn't allow you to save the changes" when attempting to change the
  kwallet configuration.

14.1/4.12.5/kde/kde-workspace:  applied patch so that KDM does not crash
  when you select a desktop environment other than KDE or XFCE.
  Moved the kde*.desktop files to /usr/share/xsessions so that other login

current/4.13.0/kde/kde-workspace:  same changes as above.  In addition, the
  version was upgraded from 4.11.8 to 4.11.9.

  No guarantees about its useability on Slackware 14.1.  I will make available
  the final KDE 4.12 release (4.12.5) for Slackware 14.1, in two weeks.
  This release includes the latest version 4.11.8 of the kde-workspace package
  just like was the case with the previous KDE SC 4.12.  For this release I
  have also added the very latest version of the Calligra office suite, 2.8.2.
  Since the previous KDE 4.12, two dependencies were updated: akonadi and
  soprano, and three new packages have been added: eigen3, qt-gstreamer
  and xapian-core.
  One noteworthy addition in KDE 4.13 is baloo, which is the next generation
  of the nepomuk project.  It's responsible for handling user metadata such as
  tags, rating and comments.  It also handles indexing and searching for files,
  emails, contacts, and so on.

  actually compiled on Slackware 14.1 for maximum compatibility).
  This release does not include a version 4.12.x of the Plasma Workspaces,
  since it was feature-frozen in 4.11.  The work done in KDE 4.12 will be
  mainly about improving and polishing KDE Applications.
  I ship kde-workspace-4.11.8 along with KDE 4.12.4.
  One package was renamed: kdnssd is now called zeroconf-ioslave.  I also
  updated to the new Calligra 2.8.1.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed Mar  5 20:49:43 UTC 2014
current/4.12.3/kde: added the missing kwalletmanager package. For KDE 4.12.3,
  the old 'kwallet' package had been renamed to 'kwalletmanager' and I had
  not spotted that.
  Upgrade using "upgradepkg kwallet%/path/to/kwalletmanager-4.12.3-*.txz".

+--------------------------+

  in KDE SC 4.12.3).

+--------------------------+
Mon Feb 10 21:22:31 UTC 2014
current/4.12.2/kdei: added hardlinks in new directory x86/kdei pointing to
  the existing packages in the x86_64/kdei directory.  Does not use up
  any space on your hard drive, and you will be able to upgrade your
  kde-l10n package with slackpkg+ now.
14.1/4.11.5/kdei: added hardlinks for reasons explained above.
14.0/4.10.5/kdei: added hardlinks for reasons explained above.

  You have a choice of NetworkManager GUI: the original 'networkmanagement'
  widget or the new QML based 'plasma-nm' applet.  The packages required for
  the Plasma NetworkManager applet are: libmm-qt, libnm-qt and plasma-nm itself.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Tue Jan  7 20:10:02 UTC 2014
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.11.5 for Slackware 14.1 (and -current).
  These packages will not work on Slackware 14.0. 
  PIasma-nm is the future replacement of the networkmanagement widget.  Try
  it out, it works well for me.
  I also provide a recompiled version of the calligra package because the
  updated libraries in KDE 4.11 break the calligra-words of Slackware 14.1.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

  Qt-Quick in Plasma Workspaces, faster Nepomuk indexing, Kontact improvements,
  OpenGL improvements in KWin (and a start of support for Wayland).
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Thu Nov  7 23:39:08 UTC 2013
current/4.11.3/kde/kde-baseapps:  Applied a patch for a serious regression
  in dolphin.  Dolphin no longer accepted URLs containing a kio-slave as
  parameter (like "dolphin trash:/") and would open the Home directory instead.

+--------------------------+
Tue Nov  5 18:49:00 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.11.3 for Slackware-current (aka 14.1).
  These packages will not work on Slackware 14.0. 
  I added a few experimental packages which will likely become the future 
  replacement of the networkmanagement widget.
  These packages are: libmm-qt, libnm-qt and plasma-nm.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Tue Oct 22 09:11:38 UTC 2013
current/4.11.2/kde/kdelibs:  Rebuilt.  Reverted three upstream commits which
  (although technically correct) have the effect of causing KDE to display
  the wrong icons in some cases.
  You may have to clear your KDE caches to see the effect for an existing
  user account.

+--------------------------+
Wed Oct 16 14:46:42 UTC 2013
current/4.11.2/kde/calligra:  Rebuilt. This was not originally in my ktown
  package set, but the "words" program in Slackware-current's own calligra
  package was broken after the upgrade of the 'marble' package of KDE 4.11.2.

+--------------------------+
Wed Oct 16 12:17:17 UTC 2013
current/4.11.2/kde/ark:  Rebuilt. The libarchive update in -current had
  broken it.

  clicking taskbar entries requires double click).

+--------------------------+
Sun Sep  1 18:15:53 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.11.1 for Slackware-current.
  These packages will not work on Slackware 14.0.

  Qt-Quick in Plasma Workspaces, faster Nepomuk indexing, Kontact improvements,
  OpenGL improvements in KWin (and a start of support for Wayland).
  The upgrade from Slackware-current's own 4.10.5 will be trivial.
  Only four packages outside KDE (the 'deps') need an update: akonadi, attica,
  shared-desktop-ontologies and soprano.
  Four KDE packages have been removed since the KDE 4.10.5 of Slackware-current:
  * kdeadmin, kdetoys, kdesdk and kdenetwork have been split up into smaller
    individual packages since 4.10.5.

+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 20 14:45:08 UTC 2013

  a newer release available (2.8.0).
current/kde/nepomuk-core:  Moved the directory /etc/kde/dbus-1 to /etc/dbus-1
  where it belongs.

+--------------------------+

    individual packages since 4.10.5.
  I removed the calligra packages which were present in my 4.11_rc1 package set,
  because Slackware-current has been updated to the most recent Calligra
  release (2.7.1).

+--------------------------+
Sun Jul 21 15:30:55 UTC 2013
current/kde/amarok:  Patched to fix crashes in KDE 4.11.

+--------------------------+
Sun Jul 21 12:50:52 UTC 2013
Thanks for reporting your bugs with my packages on my blog.  Here are the
  first results of your reports:
current/kde/networkmanagement:  Upgraded to 0.9.0.9 because the current version
  does not work with KDE 4.11
current/kde/kwebkitpart:  Rebuilt because of a report that Konqueror with
  webkit engine crashed in KDE 4.11RC1 when opening gcc.gnu.org.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jul 17 14:34:02 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.11 RC1 (aka 4.10.95) for
  Slackware-current.  These packages will not work on Slackware 14.0.
  Note that this is 'just' a release candidate for the upcoming KDE 4.11,
  which means it will contain bugs.  Please report any bugs you find, so that
  KDE 4.11 will be a quality product: https://bugs.kde.org/
  There are four upgraded 'deps': akonadi, attica, shared-desktop-ontologies
  and soprano.  I also added the new Calligra 2.7.0 to the 'kde' package set.
  Four KDE packages have been removed because they have have been split up
  into smaller individual packages: kdeadmin, kdetoys, kdesdk and kdenetwork.

+--------------------------+
Mon Jul  2 00:46:28 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.10.5 for Slackware 14.0.
  Now that Slackware-current has an official set of KDE 4.10.x packages,
  provided by Patrick Volkerding, I am offering my own packages for
  Slackware 14.0 - so that users of this stable release can enjoy the
  KDE upgrade as well.
  If you already have my previous KDE 4.10.4 packages installed, then
  there are a few updated 'extragear' packages: libkscreen, kscreen,
  oxygen-gtk2 and oxygen-gtk3.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sun Jun  9 22:27:34 UTC 2013
14.0/kde/kde-runtime:  Use -DSAMBA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/samba-4.0 with

  If you already have my previous KDE 4.10.3 packages installed then there
  is only one update besides the KDE Software Compilation: calligra.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed May 15 14:56:21 UTC 2013
14.0/kde/kdelibs:  Patched to fix a crash exiting KDE or quitting some apps
  (KDEBUG 319137)

+--------------------------+
Thu May  9 22:11:31 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.10.3 for Slackware 14.0.
  Now that Slackware-current has an official set of KDE 4.10.x packages,
  provided by Patrick Volkerding, I am offering my own packages for
  Slackware 14.0 - so that users of this stable release can enjoy the

  If you already have my previous KDE 4.10.2 packages installed then there
  are updates in the 'deps' directory, as well as a lot of new stuff in the
  'kde' directory.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sun Apr 14 21:01:55 UTC 2013

  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Thu Mar  7 08:58:55 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.10.1 for Slackware 14.0 (!).
  Now that Slackware-current has an official set of KDE 4.10.1 packages,
  provided by Patrick Volkerding, I have rebuilt my own KDE packages for
  Slackware 14.0 so that users of this stable release can enjoy the
  KDE upgrade as well.  I deleted the "current/4.10.1" package directory and
  added the rebuilt packages in "14.0/4.10.1".
  The upgrade from Slackware 14's own 4.8.5 is trivial.  I added nine
  updated dependencies (PyQt, akonadi, attica, phonon-gstreamer, qt,
  shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano and virtuoso-ose)
  and added a new one: qjson.
  I updated several 'extragear' packages compared to Slackware 14: calligra,
  kdevelop, kdevplatform, oxygen-gtk2, skanlite, and two are all new,
  oxygen-gtk3 and kio-mtp.
  If you already have my previous KDE 4.10.0 packages installed then all you
  have to upgrade are the packages in the 'kde' directory.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Tue Mar  5 08:58:18 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.10.1 for Slackware current (!).
  If you are running Slackware 14 then I cannot guarantee that these packages
  will work, and you are probably better off compiling them from source.
  The upgrade from Slackware-current's own 4.10.0 will be trivial.  There
  are *no* new or updated dependencies, the KDE packages are all there is.
  I updated a few 'extragear' packages compared to Slackware-current:
  oxygen-gtk2, oxygen-gtk3 and skanlite which finally has a 1.0 version number.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sat Feb  9 23:49:27 UTC 2013
4.10.0/kde/kde-workspace:  applied a patch to try and fix the "simple locker"
  behaviour to always require an unlock password, even if "no password"
  was configured for the screensaver. 
4.10.0/kde/nepomuk-core:  applied a patch which fixes the broken "recursive
  file indexing" in Nepomuk.

+--------------------------+
Tue Feb  5 20:37:02 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.10.0 for Slackware 14 and later.

  shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano and virtuoso-ose)
  and added a new one: qjson.
  I updated several 'extragear' packages compared to Slackware 14: calligra,
  kdevelop, kdevplatform, oxygen-gtk2, skanlite, and two are all new,
  oxygen-gtk3 and kio-mtp.
  Four KDE packages have been removed since the KDE 4.8.5 of Slackware 14:
  * kdegames has been split up into smaller individual packages since 4.10.
  * kdemultimedia has been split up into smaller individual packages since 4.9.
  * ksecrets has been removed completely since the 4.9.x series.
  * printer-applet has been replaced with print-manager since 4.10.x.
  Note that KDE 4.10.0 requires cmake 2.8.10 - this is present in Slackware
  -current but not part of Slackware 14, so you'll have to upgrade cmake there.
  Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and
  upgrade instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed Jan  2 11:44:09 UTC 2013
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.9.5 for Slackware 14 and later.
  The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.5 will be trivial.  I added five
  updated dependencies (akonadi, qt, soprano, shared-desktop-ontologies and

4.9.4/kde/kdelibs:  applied a patch to fix a bug where .odt and other zip-
  based files would not open properly in external applications when clicked
  in dolphin (BUG 311214).  Unfortunately the bug was not detected until
  right after release of KDE 4.9.4.

+--------------------------+
Wed Dec  5 11:18:18 UTC 2012
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.9.4 for Slackware 14 and later.
The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.5 will be trivial.  I added five
updated dependencies (akonadi, qt, soprano, shared-desktop-ontologies and
virtuoso-ose).  One of those dependencies has been updated since my previous
KDE 4.9.3 packages: qt.
I updated several 'extragear' packages compared to Slackware 14, of which
two are all new: kdevelop, kdevplatform, oxygen-gtk2, oxygen-gtk3
and kio-mtp.

This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.9.3 for Slackware 14 and later.
The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.5 will be trivial.  I added five
  updated dependencies (akonadi, qt, soprano, shared-desktop-ontologies and
  virtuoso-ose).  Two of those dependencies have been updated since my previous
  KDE 4.9.2 packages: akonadi and qt.
I created several updated 'extragear' packages this time, of which one is all
  new: kdevelop, kdevplatform, oxygen-gtk2 and oxygen-gtk3.
Two KDE packages have been removed since the KDE 4.8.5 of Slackware 14:
  * kdemultimedia has been split up into several smaller individual packages.
  * ksecrets has been removed completely in the 4.9.x series.
Please read the accompanying README file for detailed installation and upgrade
  instructions!

4.9.2/kde/kross-interpreters:  added... once blacklisted for KDE 4.7.1 because
  of Ruby build errors, I had forgotten to fix the error and re-enable it.

+--------------------------+
Tue Oct  2 12:21:34 UTC 2012

4.9.0/deps/virtuoso-ose: the x86_64 package carried the build/tag of 'alien'
  instead of '1alien'. Fixed now.

+--------------------------+
Fri Aug  3 00:26:44 UTC 2012
4.9.0/deps/virtuoso-ose: updated to 6.1.6 because of reports that this is
  the best version for KDE 4.9.0.
4.9.0/kde/okular: rebuilt against the upgraded poppler-0.20.2 which appeared
  in Slackware exactly for this reason.  With this version of poppler, okular
  is able to save annotations into PDF files.

+--------------------------+
Wed Aug  1 17:24:39 UTC 2012
This is KDE Software Compilation 4.9.0 for Slackware-14-Beta1 (and newer).
  The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.4 will be trivial.  There are three
  updated dependencies (akonadi, soprano and shared-desktop-ontologies).
  Two KDE packages have been removed, compared to KDE 4.8.4: ksecrets and

This is the first Release Candidate of KDE Software Compilation 4.9
  for Slackware-current.
  The official version number for KDE 4.9-rc1 is "4.8.95".
  The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.4 will be trivial.  There are three
  updated dependencies (akonadi, soprano and shared-desktop-ontologies) of
  which akonadi is new since the previous KDE 4.9-beta1.
  Two KDE packages have been removed, compared to KDE 4.8.4: ksecrets and

+--------------------------+
Mon Jun 25 18:52:56 UTC 2012
current/4.8.90/breakfix:  Added attica-0.3.0 packages which you will need
  after today's update to Slackware-current.  Many of the binaries in my
  KDE 4.8.90 packages link against libattica.so.3 ; but unfortunately
  Slackware-current's version of that library was updated to version 4.
  Until I release KDE 4.9-RC1 packages, this is how you fix the breakage:
  (1) make sure you have both the attica-0.3.0 and Slackware's newer 0.4.0
      handy.
  (2) run "upgradepkg attica-0.3.0-*.txz" to *downgrade* from 0.4.0 to 0.3.0
  (3) run "installpkg attica-0.4.0-*.txz" to install the official 0.4.0
      alongside 0.3.0.
  When I release a new set of KDE 4.9 (beta/rc/whatever) packages, you can
  finally "removepkg /var/log/packages/attica-0.3.0-*" to get rid of the old
  attica.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jun 13 17:19:35 UTC 2012
This is the second Beta of KDE Software Compilation 4.9 for Slackware-current.
  Its version number is "4.8.90".
  The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.2 qill be trivial.  There are two
  updated dependencies (soprano and shared-desktop-ontologies).
  Two KDE packages have been removed: ksecrets and kdemultimedia (the latter
  has in fact been split up into several smaller individual packages).
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!

+--------------------------+
Thu Jun  7 13:36:21 UTC 2012
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.8.4 for Slackware '-current'.
  It is an incremental update to the version 4.8.2 which is part of
  Slackware-current since a few weeks ago.  It is also the final installment
  of the KDE 4.8.x series.  I uploaded the first beta of the future 4.9.x
  series a couple of days ago, but a stable release for that is still
  months away.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sun Jun  3 12:32:22 UTC 2012
This is the first Beta of KDE Software Compilation 4.9 for Slackware-current.
  Its version number is "4.8.80".
  The KDE release team has opened a page for distros which offer the beta
  releases of KDE 4.9 in order to give this new series better coverage for bug
  hunting: http://community.kde.org/Getinvolved/Testing/Beta/InstallingBeta1
  and Slackware is listed first ;-)
  The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.2 qill be trivial.  I added one updated
  dependency (soprano) and one KDE package has been removed: kdemultimedia has
  been split up into several smaller individual packages.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!

+--------------------------+
Wed May  2 19:51:50 UTC 2012
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.8.3 for Slackware '-current'.
  It is an incremental update to the version 4.8.2 which was added to
  Slackware-current a few weeks ago.  And since Patrick updated the
  libbluedevil and devil packages in '-current' already (or will do so
  very soon after this post), I could skip those and limit this upgrade
  to just the KDE core.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!

+--------------------------+
Tue Apr  3 19:04:29 UTC 2012
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.8.2 for Slackware.
  Another bugfix release in the 4.8 series.
  Not much changed since my previous package set, most obvious is the
  large amount of version updates in the "deps" section.
  You have to be running Slackware-current in order to use these packages.
  You must *recompile* everything if you want to run KDE 4.8.2 on
  Slackware 13.37 or earlier, because of an incompatible update of glibc
  in slackware-current.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  * A lot of the dependencies have been updated since my previous KDE 4.8.1:
    PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, grantlee, libdbusmenu-qt, phonon,
    phonon-mplayer, qt, raptor2, rasqal, redland, sg3_utils,
    shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano.
  * Updated dependencies with regard to Slackware-current are:
    PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, clucene, ebook-tools, hunspell,
    libdbusmenu-qt, libvncserver, phonon, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal,
    redland, shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano, strigi,
    system-config-printer.
  * Dependencies that are not part of Slackware at all (yet):
    grantlee, herqq, libatasmart, libbluedevil, libssh, phonon-gstreamer,
    phonon-xine, sg3_utils and udisks.
  * Note that the polkit-qt package has been moved from "kde" to "deps"
    since that is what it is: a dependency, not a KDE app.  Read my earlier
    announcement of KDE 4.8.0 for even more bla^H^H^Hinfo.

+--------------------------+
Sun Mar 11 12:12:56 UTC 2012
4.8.1/deps/lcms2:  added as this is a dependency for calligra's "krita".
4.8.1/kde/calligra:  rebuilt against lcms2 to make krita work.

+--------------------------+
Tue Mar  6 13:14:57 UTC 2012
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.8.1 for Slackware.
  Overall a nice improvement to 4.8.0, so far it proves to be rock-stable.
  Not much changed since my previous package set, most visible is the
  inclusion of Calligra 2.4_rc1 - the first release candidate of the office
  suite which is going to replace KOffice.
  You have to be running Slackware-current in order to use these packages.
  You must recompile everything if you want to run KDE 4.8.1 on
  Slackware 13.37 or earlier, because of an incompatible update of glibc
  in slackware-current.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  * A few dependencies have been updated since my previous KDE 4.8.0:
    akonadi and phonon-gstreamer.
  * Updated dependencies with regard to the stable Slackware 13.37 are:
    PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, clucene, ebook-tools, hunspell,
    libdbusmenu-qt, libvncserver, phonon, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal,
    redland, shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano, strigi,
    system-config-printer and virtuoso-ose.
  * Dependencies that are not part of Slackware 13.37 at all (yet):
    grantlee, herqq, libatasmart, libbluedevil, libssh, phonon-gstreamer,
    phonon-xine, sg3_utils and udisks.
  * Note that the libktorrent and polkit-qt packages have been moved from
    "kde" to "deps" since that is what they are: dependencies, not KDE apps.
  Read my earlier announcement of KDE 4.8.0 for even more bla^H^H^Hinfo.

+--------------------------+
Thu Feb  2 09:44:00 UTC 2012
4.8.0/deps/qt:   Applied patch to provide a fix for vulnerability CVE-2011-3922
  (stack-based buffer overflow). Applied a patch which tries to work around a
  change in path name queries, which broke system sounds in KDE (among others).

+--------------------------+
Sat Jan 28 16:36:33 UTC 2012
4.8.0/kde/kde-workspace:  make KDM look first in Slackware's standard xsessions
  directory /usr/share/xsessions ; also remove the xfce*.desktop xsession files
  which are shipped with KDM (our XFCE package provides this already).
  Requested by Robby Workman.

+--------------------------+
Thu Jan 26 15:06:28 UTC 2012
4.8.0/kde/kdelibs:  patched to make UPnP support optional. UPnP support in
 Solid now depends on the environment variable SOLID_UPNP.  You can enable
  UPnP e.g. by creating an executable script '/etc/profile.d/upnp.sh' file
  containing the following contents:
  export SOLID_UPNP=1

+--------------------------+
Wed Jan 25 18:49:37 UTC 2012
4.8.0/kdei : Added the "alien" tag to all language packs... oops.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jan 25 16:10:41 UTC 2012
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.8.0 for Slackware.
  You have to be running Slackware-current in order to use these packages.
  You have to recompile everything if you want to run KDE 4.8.0 on
  Slackware 13.37 or earlier, because of an incompatible update of glibc
  in slackware-current.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  * Several dependencies have been updated since my previous KDE 4.7.4:
    akonadi, attica, hunspell, libatasmart, libvncserver, phonon, phonon-xine,
    polkit-qt-1, qt, strigi, udisks, and upower
  * Updated dependencies with regard to the stable Slackware 13.37 are:
    PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, clucene, ebook-tools, hunspell,
    libdbusmenu-qt, libvncserver, phonon, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal,
    redland, shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano, strigi,
    system-config-printer and virtuoso-ose.
  * Dependencies that are not part of Slackware 13.37 at all (yet):
    grantlee, herqq, libatasmart, libbluedevil, libssh, phonon-gstreamer,
    phonon-xine, sg3_utils and udisks.
  * The libktorrent and polkit-qt packages have been moved from "kde" to
    "deps" since that is what they are: dependencies, not KDE apps.
  Some house-keeping stuff that I keep repeating because it is mostly
  identical to the previous 4.7 releases but still worthwhile to read:
  * You will find three new KDE applications: bluedevil (a GUI for the KDE
    bluetooth framework which integrates better than the GTK-based blueman),
    kplayer (a KDE integrated front-end to mplayer) and wicd-kde (a KDE
    applet plus kcontrol for WICD that integrates perfectly into KDE,
    replacing the GTK-based client of the wicd package).
  * I also added oxygen-gtk2 (previously named 'oxygen-gtk') which is a
    theme engine giving GTK based applications an integrated KDE
    look-and-feel (provided you are using KDE's default Oxygen theme).
  * And finally I added (back from the dead) quanta. This is a bit of an
    experiment, since the new Quanta Plus has not even been released yet.
    The Quanta Plus web development software was only available as a Qt3
    application until now, but its developers are working hard on a Qt4 port,
    re-creating it as a plugin for kdevelop.
    I was able to include beta versions of kdevplatform and kdevelop
    (accompanied by a new package 'kdevelop-pg-qt') to support quanta.
    Use these four at your own risk!  If you can't live without it and were
    stuck with KDE 3 for all this time because of it, now may be the perfect
    time to try Slackware-current, KDE 4.8.0 and Quanta 3.9.0 !
  Last but not least... there is NetworkManager 0.9 support now (optionally):
  I added a small set of packages to a subdirectory called "test".
  The "test" directory contains NetworkManager plus related packages, as well
  as a native KDE applet/kcontrol called "networkmanagement".  If you are using
  KDE on a laptop and want to try managing your network connections using
  NetworkManager instead of WICD, then these packages are for you.  The README
  file inside the 4.8.0 directory has all the details.

+--------------------------+
Fri Dec 23 13:18:36 UTC 2011
4.7.4/kde/bluedevil:  Added missing bluedevil package.  I forgot to re-add it
  because it was not rebuilt since KDE 4.7.3.  Thanks Doctor Fungus.

+--------------------------+
Sun Dec 18 21:33:16 UTC 2011
4.7.4/kde/kdelibs:  Fix for https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288963 which
  was affecting number entry in several KDE apps.

+--------------------------+
Mon Dec 12 22:48:10 UTC 2011
4.7.4/kde/kplayer:  Added missing kplayer package.  I omitted to re-add it
  because it was not rebuilt since KDE 4.7.3.  Thanks Boni Xavier.

+--------------------------+
Sun Dec 11 18:24:22 UTC 2011
4.7.4/kde/kde-workspace:  [* 32-bit version only *] rebuilt in the presence
  of NetworkManager, so that it allows the networkmanagement applet to work.
  If you do _not_ use NetworkManager, then upgrading to this rebuilt package
  is still safe: it will _not_ have any negative effects.

+--------------------------+
Tue Dec  6 22:58:10 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.7.4 for Slackware.
  You have to be running Slackware-current in order to use these packages.
  No guarantees are made about their useability on Slackware 13.37 (but it is
  likely that it will run just fine).
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  * Several dependencies have been updated since my previous KDE 4.7.3:
    attica, libktorrent, libmsn, and soprano.
  * Updated dependencies with regard to the stable Slackware 13.37 are:
    PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, clucene, ebook-tools, hunspell,
    libdbusmenu-qt, phonon, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal, redland,
    shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano, strigi, system-config-printer

    phonon-xine, sg3_utils and udisks.
  * The libktorrent and polkit-qt packages have been moved from "kde" to
    "deps" since that is what they are, dependencies, not KDE apps.
  * Since this is the final release in the KDE 4.7 series, I have updated
    some of Slackware's packages which I do not touch that often: amarok,
    ktorrent and skanlite, so that you have a complete KDE experience.
  Some house-keeping stuff that I keep repeating because it is mostly
  identical to the previous 4.7 releases but still worthwhile to read:

    The Quanta Plus web development software was only available as a Qt3

    re-creating it as a plugin for kdevelop.
    So I had to use git snapshots for kdevplatform, kdevelop and quanta.
    Use these three at your own risk!  If you can't live without it and were
    stuck with KDE 3 for all this time because of it, now may be the perfect

+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 23 18:13:39 UTC 2011
4.6.5/deps/akonadi:  applied a patch that prevents akonadi from crashing when
  logging out of KDE.

+--------------------------+
Thu Nov 10 21:34:06 UTC 2011
4.7.3/deps/libmsn:  added an updated package. KDE's Kopete stopped working with
  MSN a few days ago, because the version of libmsn which is present in
  Slackware is too old.

+--------------------------+
Tue Nov  1 21:22:35 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.7.3 for Slackware.
  You have to be running Slackware-current in order to use these packages.
  No guarantees are made about their useability on Slackware 13.37 (but it is
  likely that it will run just fine).
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  * Several dependencies have been updated since my previous KDE 4.7.2:
    akonadi, grantlee, libbluedevil, libssh, phonon, shared-desktop-ontologies
    and upower.
  * Updated dependencies with regard to the stable Slackware 13.37 are:
    PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, clucene, ebook-tools, hunspell,
    libdbusmenu-qt, phonon, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal, redland,
    shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano, strigi, system-config-printer
    and virtuoso-ose.
  * Dependencies that are not part of Slackware 13.37 at all (yet):
    grantlee, herqq, libatasmart, libbluedevil, libssh, phonon-gstreamer,
    phonon-xine, sg3_utils and udisks.

  Last but not least... there is also NetworkManager support now (optionally):
  After I released the KDE 4.7.2 set, I added a small set of packages to
  a subdirectory called "test".  I have repeated that for the KDE 4.7.3 set.
  The "test" directory contains NetworkManager plus related packages, as well

4.6.5/kde/kdeutils:  rebuilt after applying a fix for CVE-2011-2725
  (* Security fix *)
4.7.2/kde/kdeutils:  rebuilt after applying a fix for CVE-2011-2725
  (* Security fix *)

+--------------------------+
Mon Oct 10 22:59:04 UTC 2011
4.7.2/kde/test:  in the "test" directory you will find some packages that
  add native and fully integrated NetworkrMmanager support in KDE.
  Not a single Gnome package (like "nm-applet") is needed!
  The included new "dependencies" are: NetworkManager, ModemManager,
  cnetworkmanager and mobile-broadband-provider-info, 
  The kde-workspace was rebuilt so that it would pick up support for NM in the
  solid hardware device framework. And the new KDE package "networkmanagement"
  gives you a nice network configurator in System Settings as well as a
  plasmoid (aka widget) which can be added to your system tray.
  Read the included README file for instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sun Oct  9 17:25:05 UTC 2011
4.7.2/kde/kdelibs:  applied a patch to fix a serious bug which prevented any
  Nepomuk query which does NOT use wide unicode characters to fail.
4.7.2/kde/kdepim-runtime:  applied a patch which fixes bug 283467: Kmail would
  have duplicated "inbox/sent-mail etc..." folders after migration from a
  previous version.

  * I also added oxygen-gtk which is a theme engine giving GTK based
    applications an integrated KDE look-and-feel (provided you as using
    KDE's default Oxygen theme).
  * And finally I added (back from the dead) quanta. This is a bit of an
    experiment, since the new Quanta Plus has not even been released yet.
    The Quanta Plus web development software was only available as a Qt3
    application until now, but its developers are working hard on a Qt4 port,
    re-creating it as a plugin for kdevelop.
    So I had to use bleeding edge git snapshots for kdevplatform, kdevelop and
    quanta.  Use these three at your own risk!  If you can't live without it
    and stuck with KDE 3 for all this time because of it, now may be the perfect
    time to try Slackware-current, KDE 4.7.2 and Quanta 3.9.0 !

+--------------------------+
Sun Sep 25 16:58:15 UTC 2011
4.6.5/kde/kdelibs:  applied a fix for CVE-2011-3365 (vulnerability in the kssl
  kioslave).
  (* Security fix *)
4.7.1/kde/kdelibs:  applied a fix for CVE-2011-3365 (vulnerability in the kssl
  kioslave).
  (* Security fix *)

+--------------------------+
Wed Sep 21 11:07:39 UTC 2011
4.7.1/kde/kdepim-runtime:  applied a patch that prevents accidental deletion of
  new email when retrieved by KMail from a POP3 server into a 'maildir' folder.
  This bug was introduced in the 4.7.0 version of kdepim-runtime, so if you are
  still running KDE 4.7.0 and use KMail, a it is wise to upgrade.

+--------------------------+
Sun Sep 11 02:02:55 UTC 2011
kde/kde-workspace:  rebuilt after applying a patch to fix a performance bug in
  KWin - it seems to have been present in all 4.x releases.  Read more in
  http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2011/08/rendering-at-60-frames/

+--------------------------+
Sat Sep 10 14:24:32 UTC 2011
deps/virtuoso-ose:  rebuilt after applying a patch which fixes issues with
  Unicode pathnames - see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=271664.

+--------------------------+
Tue Sep  6 19:27:03 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.7.1 for Slackware.
You have to be running Slackware-current in order to use these packages.
  No guarantees are made about their useability on Slackware 13.37.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  There are several updated dependencies since my KDE 4.7.0:
  PyQt, akonadi, clucene, libbluedevil, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal,
  redland, sip and soprano,
  Updated dependencies with regard to the stable Slackware 13.37 are:
  PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, clucene, ebook-tools, hunspell,
  libdbusmenu-qt, phonon, polkit-qt-1, qt, raptor2, rascal, redland,
  shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano, system-config-printer and
  virtuoso-ose.
  Dependencies that are not part of Slackware 13.37 at all (yet):
  grantlee, herqq, libatasmart, libbluedevil, libssh, phonon-gstreamer,
  phonon-xine, sg3_utils and udisks.
  The polkit-qt package was moved from "kde" to "deps" in my 4.7.0 release.
  You will find two new KDE applications: bluedevil (a GUI for the KDE
  bluetooth framework which integrates better than the GTK-based blueman),
  and kplayer (a KDE integrated front-end to mplayer).
  I also added oxygen-gtk which is a theme engine giving GTK based applications
  an integrated KDE look-and-feel (provided you as using KDE's default Oxygen
  theme).
  And finally I added (back from the dead) quanta. This is a bit of an
  experiment, since the new Quanta Plus has not even been released yet.
  The Quanta Plus web development software was only available as a Qt3
  application until now, but its developers are working hard on a Qt4 port,
  re-creating it as a plugin for kdevelop.
  So I had to use bleeding edge git snapshots for kdevplatform, kdevelop and
  quanta.  Use these three at your own risk!  If you can't live without it
  and stuck with KDE 3 for all this time because of it, now may be the perfect
  time to try Slackware-current, KDE 4.7.1 and Quanta 3.9.0 !

+--------------------------+
Thu Aug  4 13:43:57 UTC 2011
kde/konq-plugins:  Removed.  The content of this package has been integrated
  into the 'kdebase' package (it is part of the 'kde-baseapps' source tarball
  since 4.7).

+--------------------------+
Wed Aug  3 19:20:32 UTC 2011
deps/herqq:  patched the SlackBuild script and rebuilt the x86_64 package
  because it was installing libraries incorrectly into /usr/lib .  It looks
  like no rebuild of kdelibs is required.

+--------------------------+
Tue Aug  2 19:00:52 UTC 2011
deps/phonon-gstreamer: Added.  The gstreamer and xine backends were split out
  of the new phonon 4.5.0 which ships with my KDE 4.7.0.  This means that any
  application that uses phonon for its output was suddenly limited to using
  the not fully mature mplayer backend. This new package restores the lost
  functionality.
deps/phonon-xine: Added.  For the same reasons as above. 

+--------------------------+
Mon Aug  1 11:18:47 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.7.0 for Slackware.
You have to be running Slackware 13.37 (32bit or 64bit) or -current in order
  to use these packages. They were built on slackware-current!

  virtuoso-ose.
  Dependencies that are not part of Slackware 13.37 at all (yet):
  grantlee, herqq (added for KDE 4.7.0), libatasmart, libbluedevil, libssh,
  sg3_utils, udisks.
  The polkit-qt package was moved from "kde" to "deps".
  And finally, two new KDE applications are bluedevil (a GUI for the KDE
  bluetooth framework), and kplayer (a KDE integrated front-end to mplayer).

+--------------------------+
Tue Jul 26 18:26:10 UTC 2011
4.6.5/kde/kdeutils:  Rebuilt with a patchset to make kcalc work again.
4.6.5/kdei/kde-l10n-*:  Rebuilt because the KDE team released new language
  sources.

+--------------------------+
Thu Jul  7 08:39:01 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.6.5 for Slackware.

  libssh, sg3_utils, udisks. And bluedevil of course which I added to "kde".

+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 11 11:59:11 UTC 2011
4.6.4/deps: Removed an older version of the QScintilla package that was
  accidentally left in the 32bit packages directory.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jun  8 15:27:02 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.6.4 for Slackware.
You have to be running Slackware 13.37 (32bit or 64bit) or newer in order to
  use these packages. They were built on -current.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  The stable release 4.6.0 of the kdepim and kdepim-runtime packages is
  included as well. YES! This release has taken a long time to stabilize,
  after it had basically been re-written from scratch.

Sun May  8 00:33:49 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.6.3 for Slackware.
  Have fun with these packages for Slackware 13.37 (comes in 32-bit as well
  as 64-bit flavours).  
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  Updated dependencies since KDE 4.6.2 if you have that installed already:
  sip, PyQt, QScintilla.
  New dependency package since KDE 4.6.2: libbluedevil.
  Updated dependencies with regard to the stable Slackware 13.37 are:
  PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, ebook-tools, hunspell, libdbusmenu-qt,
  sip, soprano, system-config-printer, virtuoso-ose.
  Not part of Slackware 13.37 at all (yet): grantlee, libatasmart, libbluedevil,
  libssh, sg3_utils, udisks.
4.6.3/kde/bluedevil:  Added. This is the new bluetooth connection manager.
4.6.3/kde/k3b:  Upgraded to the latest snapshot of the 2.0 series.
KDE SC 4.4.5 for Slackware 13.1 (and with a bit of effort, 13.0):  Removed.
  Please upgrade your Slackware. 

+--------------------------+
Sat Apr  9 14:11:31 UTC 2011
4.6.1/kde/kdebase-workspace:  patched to fix the shutdown issue in runlevel 4
  (kdm would drop you in a tty instead of powering off the computer).

+--------------------------+
Fri Apr  8 07:57:00 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.6.2 for Slackware.
  Have fun with these packages for Slackware 13.37 (comes in 32-bit as well
  as 64-bit flavours).  Assuming Slackware 13.37 has not yet been released
  by the time I post this, rest assured that it'll all work just fine on
  its Release Candidate 3.14159265 too!
  Slackware 13.37 itself sticks with KDE SC 4.5.5, which is rock stable and
  well-tested.
  Please read the accompanying README file for installation and upgrade
  instructions!
  Updated dependencies since KDE 4.6.1 if you have that installed already:
  QScintilla, akonadi, libdbusmenu-qt, system-config-printer, upower,
  virtuoso-ose.
  Other updates from Slackware: PyQt, attica, ebook-tools, hunspell, sip,
  soprano.
  Not part of Slackware at all: grantlee, libatasmart, libssh, sg3_utils,
  udisks.

+--------------------------+
Mon Mar 28 07:30:49 UTC 2011
4.6.1/kde/kdegraphics:  rebuilt against the new versoin of poppler that went
  into slackware-current.
4.6.1/kde/kdelibs:  patched with a fix for CVE-2011-1168 (a XSS vulnerability
  in konqueror).

+--------------------------+
Sun Mar 13 19:40:48 UTC 2011
4.6.1/deps/QScintilla:  rebuilt the package against the newer PyQt.  This
  fixes the segfault in the 'eric' python IDE - it runs fine now.

+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 12 21:01:58 UTC 2011
4.6.1/deps/QScintilla:  re-added the missing 2.4.6 package.  I had built this
  package for KDE 4.6.0, and it is still needed for KDE 4.6.1 (there is an
  incompatible package with version 2.4.5 in Slackware itself).

+--------------------------+
Sat Mar  5 00:22:42 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.6.1.
  Have fun with these packages for Slackware-current (32-bit as well as 64-bit).
  Slackware itself will stick with the 4.5.5 version, which is rock stable
  and well-tested.
    Several slackware packages need to be updated, there are even some entirely
  new packages (grantlee, libatasmart, libssh, sg3-utils, udisks, upower) which
  are required in order to run this new version of KDE4.  You can find all of
  these packages in the "deps" directory for your architecture.
    Accompanying this KDE release are updated packages for k3b and
  kaudiocreator because the versions in Slackware will not work with KDE 4.6.
    New for KDE are kwebkitpart, polkit-kde-kcmodules-1 and polkit-kde-agent-1
  (the two polkit packages replace the old polkit-kde-1 package which does not
  work with KDE 4.6).
    A word of caution about to the PIM packages (kdepim and kdepim-runtime):
  you can either keep the version 4.4.10 which is already included in slackware
  -current, which is stable, and compatible with KDE 4.6, _or_ you can upgrade
  to the new version 4.6beta4 which is included with my KDE 4.6 packages...
  and may not be stable enough for production use.
  See the README file for detailed installation instructions!

+--------------------------+
Sun Feb 13 13:50:22 UTC 2011
4.6.0/kde/kdeartwork:  Rebuilt because of library updates in slackware-current.
4.6.0/kde/kdebase-runtime:  Rebuilt.
4.6.0/kde/kdebindings:  Rebuilt.
4.6.0/kde/kdegraphics:  Rebuilt.
4.6.0/kde/kdeplasma-addons:  Rebuilt.

+--------------------------+
Tue Jan 25 19:57:47 UTC 2011
Release of KDE Software Compilation 4.6.0.
  Have fun with these packages for Slackware-current (32-bit as well as 64-bit).
  Slackware itself will stick with the 4.5.5 version, which is rock stable
  and well-tested.
    Several slackware packages need to be updated, there are even some entirely
  new packages (grantlee, libatasmart, libssh, sg3-utils, udisks, upower) which
  are required in order to run this new version of KDE4.  You can find all of
  these packages in the "deps" directory for your architecture.
    Accompanying this KDE release are updated packages for k3b, kaudiocreator,
  kdevplatform and kdevelop because the versions in Slackware will not work
  with KDE 4.6.  New for KDE are kwebkitpart, polkit-kde-kcmodules-1 and
  polkit-kde-agent-1 (the two polkit packages replace the old polkit-kde-1
  package which does not work with KDE 4.6).
    A word of caution about to the PIM packages (kdepim and kdepim-runtime):
  you can either keep the version 4.4.9 which is already included in slackware
  -current, which is stable, and compatible with KDE 4.6, _or_ you can upgrade
  to the new version 4.6beta4 which is included with my KDE 4.6 packages...
  and may not be stable enough for production use.
  See the README file for detailed installation instructions!

+--------------------------+
Thu Jan  6 09:09:33 UTC 2011
Release of KDE 4.6.RC2 (aka 4.5.95) packages for Slackware-current.
  This is the second release candidate for the upcoming KDE Software
  Compilation 4.6.0, use it at your own risk.
  Several slackware packages need to be updated, and there are some entirely new
  packages as well (grantlee, libatasmart, sg3-utils, udisks, upower) which you
  will need in order to run this new version of KDE4.  You will find all of
  these packages in the "deps" directory for your architecture.
  A note about the PIM 4.6beta3 packages which accompany this KDE 4.6.RC1:
  the developers have announced that they will not have a stable 4.6 version of
  their PIM software ready when KDE 4.6.0 is released.  Instead, they have
  created a stable 4.4.9 version which has been made fully compatible with
  KDE 4.6.  If you don't like the kdepim 4.6beta3 package in my repository,
  stick with the 4.4.9 version which is already part of slackware -current.
  There is a slightly newer snapshot of k3b in here, which no longer shows the
  "Make sure HAL daemon is running" text now that it no longer depends on HAL.
  I re-added the kdevelop and kdevplatform packages which I forgot to bring
  forward from the 4.5.85 build when I updated to 4.5.90.

+--------------------------+
Tue Jan  4 14:39:52 UTC 2011
kde/k3b:  updated to a newer git snapshot.  This fixes a crash bug at 100% when
  burning a CD.  It also allowed me to disable HAL support in k3b entirely.

+--------------------------+
Sun Jan  2 23:56:00 UTC 2011
kde/kdebindings:  rebuilt because of the new perl in slackware-current.

+--------------------------+
Thu Dec 23 09:48:53 UTC 2010
Release of KDE 4.6.RC1 (aka 4.5.90) packages for Slackware-current.
  This is the first release candidate for the upcoming KDE Software Compilation
  4.6.0, use it at your own risk.
  Several slackware packages need to be updated, and there are some entirely new
  packages as well (grantlee, libatasmart, sg3-utils, udisks, upower) which you
  will need in order to run this new version of KDE4.  You will find all of
  these packages in the "deps" directory for your architecture.
  The PIM software is finally available again, there are new packages for kdepim
  and kdepim-runtime which replace the old 4.4.7 packages.  Note that the PIM
  developers have announced that they will not have a stable 4.6 version ready
  when KDE 4.6.0 is released.  Instead, they will have a stable 4.4.9 release
  which has been made compatible with KDE 4.6.  If you don't like the kdepim
  4.6beta3 package in my repository, stick with the 'old' 4.4.7 of slackware
  -current.

+--------------------------+
Fri Dec 17 12:24:46 UTC 2010
deps/grantlee:  added. The kdelibs and kdepim packages enable additional
  functionality when build against this package.
kde/kdelibs:  rebuilt against grantlee (new package). Removed HAL support in
  solid. It should be safe to disable HAL now (install my phonon-mplayer
  package if your sound no longer works after disabling HAL).
kde/kdepim:  rebuilt against grantlee (new package).
kde/kdevplatform:  updated to 1.1.80. This update is required for KDE 4.6.
kde/kdevelop:  updated to 4.1.80. This update is required for KDE 4.6.

+--------------------------+
Sun Dec 12 15:07:20 UTC 2010
Release of KDE 4.6.beta2 (aka 4.5.85) packages for Slackware-current.
  This is still very much beta software, use it at your own risk.
  Several slackware packages need to be updated, and there are some entirely new
  packages as well (libatasmart, sg3-utils, udisks, upower) which you will need
  in order to run this new version of KDE4.  You will find all of these packages
  in the "deps" directory for your architecture.
  The PIM software is finally available again, there are new packages for kdepim
  and kdepim-runtime which replace the old 4.4.7 packages.

+--------------------------+
Thu Nov  4 01:04:19 UTC 2010
Release of KDE 4.5.3 packages for Slackware-current.  The packages install
  cleanly on slackware-current (32-bit and 64-bit), no additional dependencies
  are required.  If you installed KDE 4.5.1 before from slackware-current and
  upgrade using my packages, you will keep the kdepim/kdepim-runtime packages
  of slackware-current.  There *still* is no stable release of kdepim 4.5.

+--------------------------+
Fri Oct  8 22:42:47 UTC 2010
Release of KDE 4.5.2 packages for Slackware-current.  These packages install
  cleanly on slackware-current (32-bit and 64-bit), no additional dependencies
  are required.  If you installed KDE 4.5.1 before from slackware-current and
  upgrade using my packages, you will keep the kdepim/kdepim-runtime packages
  of slackware-current.  There still is no stable release of kdepim 4.5.

+--------------------------+
Fri Sep  3 07:02:48 UTC 2010
Release of KDE 4.5.1 packages for Slackware-current.  Please note, that you
  have one additional dependency to install (libdbus-qt) and that the kdepim and
  kdepim-runtime packages are still absent from this Software Compilation.
  The PIM software is still considered too unstable (but not for much longer)
  so please keep using the kdepim/kdepim-runtime packages for KDE 4.4.5.

+--------------------------+
Fri Aug  6 20:28:34 UTC 2010
This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.5.0 for Slackware-current.
  Another milestone for the KDE project with numerous improvements to the
  KDE 4.4 which we have in Slackware at the moment. Congratulations to everyone
  who helped in making this release possible, delivering on time as planned.
  NOTE:
  KDE 4.5.0 does not contain kdepim and kdepim-runtime because te PIM project
  was unable to deliver a stable version in time for release. You will have to
  use the version 4.4.5 of the kdepim and kdepim-runtime packages which are
  present in Slackware-current. In one of the future releases of KDE 4.5.x the
  new kdepim will finally be added to the Software Compilation.

+--------------------------+
Tue Jul 27 20:53:30 UTC 2010
4.4.95/deps: re-added libdbusmenu-qt.  Obviously I had forgotten to upload
  this required dependency to the repository. The KDE 4.4-rc packages were
  built in its presence so there is nothing else for you to do than to run
  "upgradepkg --install-new" on the package for your architecture.
  Apologies for the mix-up and thanks to Tom who pointed this out on my blog.

+--------------------------+
Mon Jul 26 20:05:49 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.95 (this is 4.5-rc3) packages for Slackware-current (32-bit and
  64-bit).  There is also one updated dependency (soprano). Note that this
  set of KDE packages no longer targets Slackware 13.1 now that -current is
  moving too far away from 13.1.

+--------------------------+
Fri Jul  9 08:40:02 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.92 (this is 4.5-rc2) packages for Slackware-13.1 (32-bit and 64-bit).
  This comes with several updated dependencies (non-KDE Slackware packages),
  most of which I already created for KDE 4.4.5.
  People asked me if I could compile some of the extragear as well (amarok,
  qtorrent, k3b) but there is simply no time for that, sorry.

+--------------------------+
Wed Jul  7 21:59:46 UTC 2010
4.4.5/deps/qt:  I thought I had grabbed a qt-4.6.3 source snapshot but I was
  mistaken... and failed to notice that it actuall still was 4.6.2.
  So thanks to some whispering in my ear, I have now updated the qt package
  with a real 4.6.3 snapshot.

+--------------------------+
Tue Jul  6 18:46:14 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.5 released for Slackware-13.1 (32-bit and 64-bit). Follow the
  installation instructions in the README.  The koffice-2.2.0 packages which
  I had built for KDE SC 4.4.4 are copied here as well.

+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 26 23:44:29 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.90 (which is in fact 4.5-rc1) packages for Slackware-13.1 (32-bit
  and 64-bit).  Help test this first release candidate so that we may see
  another stellar release of KDE in august.  Report your bugs at bugs.kde.org.

+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 12 22:05:42 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.4:  added koffice-2.2.0

+--------------------------+

KDE SC 4.4.85:  added the "kdei" sources and SlackBuild for people who want to
  build a language pack. 

+--------------------------+
Wed Jun  9 10:19:35 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.85 (better known as 4.5-beta2) released for Slackware-13.1 (32-bit
  and 64-bit). This is only for people who want to help fixing bugs in the new
  KDE!!! If you need a stable system, stick with KDE 4.4.4.
  Expected release date of a stable KDE 4.5 is august 2010.

+--------------------------+
Sun Jun  6 18:42:45 UTC 2010
KDE SC 4.4.4 released for Slackware-13.1 (32-bit and 64-bit). Follow the
